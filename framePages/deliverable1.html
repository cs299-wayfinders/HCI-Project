<h3>Group 7</h3>
Rapporteur: Chance Hein<br>
Lead Developer: Matt Nolley<br>
Webmaster: Alice Thornes<br>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<h3>Scenario A</h3>
School guest/Visitor/Parent is on a self-guided tour of the school and wants to get to Ford Hall
from Montag. Informational screens display some relevant information, but the guest is required
to ask around and/or resort to online research to obtain the necessary information. <br>
<h3>Scenario B</h3>
New student has a class in Smullin, but doesn’t know where the classroom is. Since there is no
available resource to consult, the student resorts to passing by each room until they find the one
they are looking for. This takes considerably longer and results in the student being late to their
first class. <br>
<h3>Scenario C</h3>
A visiting student from Japan who has limited understanding of campus signage is trying to find
Goudy Commons from Kaneko, but has no directory and can’t ask other students. Left without
an accessible map, they end up wandering campus until they find the cafeteria. <br>
<h2>Problem</h2>
Basic, unenhanced digital signage systems offer limited value to users walking past. If a digital
sign is by coincidence showing information relevant to a user’s interests, then the sign’s content
may be of use to them. Otherwise, the sign provides no value to the user. There’s no feedback
loop, no way to remove luck from the process of matching content to users. The interaction
problem in this case is simply that there is no real interaction. <br>
<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
The addition of touch-based interactive features, such as wayfinding, building directories, and
event calendars, would grant users the ability to view information or content specific to their
needs of the moment. Whether users are visitors who need directions, long-term students
looking for more information about upcoming events, or faculty in an unfamiliar building, an
interactive information system would be of greater value than a repeating cycle of pre-scheduled
informational images. <br>
Rather than develop an entirely new interactive digital signage solution, we propose to render
the touch-based interface signage content, and interactive features as a web page. That way it
can be shown via any digital signage hardware that can display a web page, and could be made
available to other touch-capable devices, including phones and tablets.
To inform users that interactive features are available, a proximity sensor would be used to
trigger an animated overlay. The standard digital signage content would continue to be
displayed, but icons representing wayfinding and other informational tools would be displayed
when a nearby user was detected, along with animated pointers illustrating that one can touch
the icons to interact with them. These controls would also be displayed on page load to support
use on mobile devices or other systems designed for an individual user. <br>
<h2>Personas</h2>
There are two identifiable personas who would use/require wayfinding technologies: <br>
<h3>The Visitor</h3>
This is the persona of a parent or relative to a student, or perhaps a prospective student who is
visiting the school on a tour. This persona is at a severe disadvantage due to their limited
knowledge of the school and campus, and would see the benefits of on-demand directions and
information immediately. <br>
<h3>The Student</h3>
This is the persona of a student who needs information about the building they are currently in.
This may be a new student who needs directions to a classroom, or a legacy student who is in
an unfamiliar building and needs to know where the department hearth is located. This could
also include exchange/visiting students from TIU, who are in a foreign setting and are
unaccustomed to English directories. <br>
<h2>Use Case Scenario</h2>
With our project the student above would be easily able to find the classroom they are looking
for. In a specific case, the student would be able to access an informative webpage or
application that gives directions via either instructions or a map. Additional features could
include alternative routes, classroom/office locations, etc. A fully refined version might even
have a variety of language options. <br>
<h2>Related Products</h2>
Our proposed solutions mixes elements of two existing categories of products, wayfinding apps
and interactive digital signage systems that include wayfinding features.
<h3>22miles</h3>
<h4><a href="https://www.22miles.com/digital-signage-applications-2/mobile-web-wayfinder/">https://www.22miles.com/digital-signage-applications-2/mobile-web-wayfinder/</a></h4>
22miles is a wayfinding app. It provides powerful interactive map features, but it’s limited to
mobile devices only and users must download and install it from the relevant appstore before
they can use it. <br>
<h3>Elo</h3>
<h4><a href="https://www.elotouch.com/touchscreen-signage">https://www.elotouch.com/touchscreen-signage</a></h4>
Elo is a manufacturer of interactive digital signage devices. They bill their products as
“touchscreen signage”. Their solutions are tied to proprietary devices, and are sold for uses
such as room scheduling devices and restaurant ordering kiosks, as well as more traditional
digital signage. Developing wayfinding features and building information content for their
product would require essentially the same development process as building a standalone
web-page solution. <br>
<h3>Brightsign</h3>
<h4><a href="https://www.brightsign.biz/">https://www.brightsign.biz/</a></h4>
Brightsign is a major vendor in the digital signage market, selling content management software
and media player devices. They do offer some interactive signage solutions, but those are not
their primary product. Their offerings provide interactive experiences by displaying a web page.
Therefore, a companion product along the lines of our proposed solution is required to truly
implement interactive features. <br>
<h3>Concerto</h3>
<h4><a href="https://www.concerto-signage.org/">https://www.concerto-signage.org/</a></h4>
Concerto is Willamette’s current digital signage solution. It’s an open source project maintained
by a consortium of higher-ed institutions. Concerto is a web application that manages graphical
content and produces collections of that content as discrete web pages. Concerto content can
be displayed by any device that can run a web browser. As with the other digital signage
solutions listed above, Concerto can display a web page as well as still images, and doing so is
the only way to include interactive features. However, rotation of content can not be disabled in
Concerto, which would cause interruptions of interactive user sessions. <br>
<h2>Comparing Products</h2>
Our proposed solution would fully combine wayfinding, content display, and an interactive
interface, which none of the related products above achieve. Either they only address one part
of the equation (22miles, Concerto), or they leave the wayfinding element to be handled or
developed separately (Elo, Brightsign). Our approach is to center the system around
interactivity and wayfinding while retaining content display functionality as the
background/default element.
<h2>Hi-Level Architecture of Proposed System</h2>

<h2>Feasibility</h2>
The majority of the work in support of this solution will be the development of a web application.
We already have the necessary hardware on hand, with the exception of the proximity/approach
sensor. On the web application development side, we’ll have the following major tasks:<br>
<h3>Database Design and Implementation</h3>
Our web application will need a database to store location, event, and building information. This
should not require a complex schema, so this task should only require a few hours.
<h3>Web Server and Application Framework Implementation</h3>
We’ll use standard open-source “off-the-shelf” solutions for the web server and application
framework, so this task should also require only a few hours.
<h3>Graphic Design, Icons, and Animations</h3>
Only one of our team members has strengths in this area, but it will be one of their focuses. We
estimate this part of the project will require ten hours. It could be done more quickly if necessary,
but the approachability and usefulness of our solution rely on the graphic elements connecting
with the users.
<h3>Core Application Development</h3>
The majority of our efforts will be in this area. We believe development of a rudimentary
working version of our application will take roughly 60 person-hours. Of our team members, one
has web design experience, another has previously developed web applications, and our third
has programming experience and will act as a generalist.
<h3>Proximity Sensor Integration</h3>
We believe this will be our biggest challenge, as it’s outside of the experience and comfort areas
of any of our team members. All team members will work to research, identify, and implement a
solution. We hope that process will not require more than 10 combined hours.
